# tv-watchlist-backend

## Overview

Back-end for Television Watchlist site that tracks shows through three lists: watchlist, watching, and watched. Front-end can be found in my repository [tv-watchlist](https://github.com/brynious/tv-watchlist).

## Design

Basic design with very simple schema and no relational data just yet.

## Purpose

Created to learn the MERN stack and also help my flat track some of the television shows we're watching together.

## Running on Local
